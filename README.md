# outline2tex

### A simple utility that generates embeddable tex from tab-indented outlines

## Features:
* Parentheses and embedded content will automatically be colored red

* Anything contained within curly braces will be typeset in fixed-width

## Info:

I'm using this to simplify my outline generation for course review content, but it may find future uses. I know that pandoc and other utilities (here's looking at you markdown) exist, but I felt like creating something new. Hell, someone might find it useful!
